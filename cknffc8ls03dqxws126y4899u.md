## What will be covered in this Blog

```python
1. What is Case Style?
2. Different types of Case Styles:
    - Camel case
	- Snake case & Capitalized Snake Case
	- Kebab case
	- Pascal case
```

*Let's get started!*

## What is Case Style?

If you are a programmer, chances are that you daily come across scenarios where you have to follow certain naming conventions. It's considered a good practice to know which case style to use in which scenario because say for example we cannot name a like this:`no of students = 25`

In programming, Case Style is the most common way to combine words into a single string. There are many ways in which we can combine words, the most popularly known are:

- Camel case
- Snake case & Capitalized Snake Case
- Kebab case
- Pascal case

Let's have a look at each one of them in detail. You can find all the code at my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ayushi7rawat/Youtube-Projects/tree/master/Fetch%20data%20of%20any%20country). **Drop a star** if you find it useful.

##  1. Camel case

`camel Case` starts with a lowercase letter and the first letter of every new subsequent word has its first letter capitalized and is compounded(removing the space between two words) with the previous word. This is a very popular way to combine words to form a single one.

**Use:** It is often used in variable declaration in many languages.

Let's have a look at an example:

**`RAW`:**

```python
hello world!
```

**`camel Case`:**

```python
helloWorld!
```

So, this case combined words by capitalizing the first letter of each word except the first one.

## 2. Snake case

Snake case combines words by replacing each space with an underscore (_) and lowercasing all the words. This one is the most used in Python. This is a nice, clean, readable way to combine words.

**Use:** Often used as in declaring constants in many languages. 

Let's have a look at an example:

**`RAW`:**

```python
my name is Ayushi
```

**`Snake case`:**

```python
my_name_is_Ayushi
```

In the all caps version, all letters are capitalized, called as **Capitalized Snake Case**:

Let's have a look at an example:

**`RAW`:**

```python
max student marks
```

**`Capitalized Snake Case`:**

```python
MAX_STUDENT_MARKS
```

## 3. Kebab case

This one is like Snake Case but instead of underscore, the dash is used, it combines words by replacing each space with a dash (-).

**Use:** This is rarely used in Python, but is often used in URLs. 

Let's have a look at an example:

**`Raw:`** 

```python
total student count
```

**`Kebab Case:`**

```python
total-student-count
```

## 4. Pascal case

This case is also called Upper Camel Case, it combines all words by capitalizing all them(even the first word) and removing the space between them.

**Use:** It is often used as a convention in declaring classes in many languages such as Python like `CalculateSum`.

Let's have a look at an example:

**Raw:**

```python
python is cool
```

**Pascal Case:** 

```python
PythonIsCool
```

### Concluding Thoughts:

There is no best way to combine words. It majorly depends on the use case. Although it is suggested to be consistent with case style used and considered best to agree upon a common case style when working with a team.

Simple, isn't it? Hope this tutorial has helped and you have understood all **Case Styles in programming. **
