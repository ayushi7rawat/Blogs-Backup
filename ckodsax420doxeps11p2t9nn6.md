## What is an IDE?:

An **integrated development environment** (**IDE**) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [**IDE's** Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). 


## **Features of IDE:**

- **Text editor**
  Every IDE has a text editor designed to write and manipulate source code with a simple interface and has language-specific syntax highlighting.

- **Compilers:**
  are components that translate programming language into machines understandable code called as binary code

- **Code completion**
  Code complete features save programmers time and reduce the likelihood of typos and bugs.

- **Debugger**
  Debugging tools assist users in identifying errors within source code.

- **Programming language support**
  Most IDEs support a single programming language, though several also offer multi-language support as well.

- **Integrations and plugins**
  IDE also supports integrations and plugins.
