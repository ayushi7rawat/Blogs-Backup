## What will be covered in this Blog

```python
1. Three beginner-friendly books
2. Two books for advanced learners
3. A bonus Book
4. My current favorite book
```

Some people are comfortable watching online courses, others are more comfortable reading. If you are new to reading any programming book, I will suggest a beginner-friendly book for you. I will also tell you my personal favorite book at the end.



I will recommend books in a beginner to expert order. So with that being said, *Let's get started!*

### 1. PYTHON CRASH COURSE by Eric Matthes

![10.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619415149290/wg6mYH5sl.png)

- If you have never learned a programming language before and you are starting out to learn python and want to learn the concepts real so that you can start making interesting projects real quick, PYTHON CRASH COURSE is for you. 

- This book is divided into two sections:

  - the 1st section teaches you the basics of python.
  - the second part, you work on three major projects, based on game development, web development or data visualization, etc. 

  If you are a student, you find the book a little pricey, so you can go for the online kindle version.

 

### 2. LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY

![13.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619415186301/qpd47I3DK.png)

- This is the second book recommendation, LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY.
- The book even guides with python installation.
- This is also a good beginner-friendly book and will give you a good knowledge of fundamentals. I am really fond of the author’s approach, the reader is expected to find a lot of information independently. 

Also note, the most important factor is to practice side by side regularly, just reading won’t do you any good. 

 

 

### 3.  HEAD 1ST PYTHON by paul barry:

![16.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619415231367/FMRXLItSN.png)

- This is another beginner-friendly book. It covers core concepts, Web and Android development using Python.
- It follows a graphical approach and teaches you using illustrations rather than a text-based approach to make your learning more interesting.
- It does not cover advanced topics, so is not recommended for advanced learners or experts.

 

### 4. PYTHON COOKBOOK:

![20.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619415226854/Mj0M0BQWu.png)
 
- This book will cover the core Python language as well as tasks common to a wide variety of application domains.
- I use this book as a reference for a particular topic.
- Each recipe starts out with a problem statement and contains code samples you can use in your projects, along with a discussion about how and solution walkthrough.
- It includes Data Structures, Iterators, and Generators, Files, Functions, Network and Web Programming, Utility Scripting, Testing, Debugging, and lot more

 

 

### 5. PROGRAMMING PYTHON by Mark Lutz


![23.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619415307042/1u1PGgd5r.png)
- You can pick up this book if you are aware of python fundamentals and ready to dive deep.
- It will first make you familiar with concepts of object-orientation.
- Also will give you in-depth knowledge of various domains of python, covers basics of GUI programming by tkiner, command-line processing, system administration, and a lot more to advance your skills. 

#### BONUS BOOK:

### AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON.

- This is a pretty awesome book, and the video will be incomplete without this book’s recommendation.
- the author has done a great job of explaining why python is important, a bit of history about the language, and gives so many ideas on how computing tasks can be greatly simplified.
- this book stands out in the second part where you actually build useful tools you might need to use every day.
