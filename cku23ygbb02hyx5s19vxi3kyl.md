## What is Open Source?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source),

> **Open-source** is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. 
>
> When some source code is made Open source, it includes permission to use, modify, contribute to the existing source code. The use of the term originated with the software but has expanded beyond the software sector to collaboration and contribution.

Open-source projects that are hosted in public repositories benefit from contributions made by the broader developer community and are typically managed through Git. 

Now that you have a basic idea about Open Source, we can talk about Hacktoberfest.

## What is Hacktoberfest ?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long challenge. It happens every year in the month of October. 

Hacktoberfest is open to everyone and it marks the celebration of Open Source. It's the biggest Open Source event that encourages newbies to participate in Open Source and create their 1st meaningful PR. Hacktoberfest encourages participation in giving back to the open-source community by completing pull requests, participating in events, and donating to open source projects. Also, **all backgrounds and skills levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.**
