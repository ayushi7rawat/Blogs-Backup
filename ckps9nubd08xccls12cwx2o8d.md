## Forecast Weather using Python

Hello reader! 

**Weather** is the mix of events that happen each day in our atmosphere and is different in different parts of the world and changes over minutes, hours, days, and weeks. Rain and dull clouds, windy blue skies, cold snow, and sticky heat are very different conditions, yet they are all-weather. According to the Wikipedia definition:

> **Weather** is the state of the atmosphere. 

In this blog post, we will learn how to forecast weather details. We will see the implementation in Python with hardly a few lines of code.

## What will be covered in this Blog

```python
1.	What is wttr?
2.	What is requests Module
3.	How to forecast the weather using Python
```

*Let's get started!*

## What is wttr?

> wttr â€” the right way to check the weather!

wttr.in is a console-oriented weather forecast service that supports various information representation methods like terminal-oriented ANSI-sequences for console HTTP clients (curl, httpie, or wget), HTML for web browsers, or PNG for graphical viewers.

wttr.in uses [wego](http://github.com/schachmat/wego) for visualization and various data sources for weather forecast information.

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [**wttr's** GitHub Repo](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in).

## Module Used:

### requests Module:

**Requests** is a simple, yet elegant HTTP library. It allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. Requests officially support Python 2.7 & 3.5+.

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [**Requests Module** Documentation](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).

Now that you are familiar with *Requests Module* basics and have acquired basic knowledge of *wttr,* we can move forward to *the coding section.*

## Time to Code!
You can find all the code at my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ayushi7rawat/Youtube-Projects/tree/master/Weather%20Forecast). **Drop a star** if you find it useful.

In order to access the Python library, you need to install it into your Python environment

```python
pip install requests
```

Now, we need to import the package into our python script. Use the following command to do so.

```python
import requests
```

Now that we have imported the library using the command `import requests`, let's proceed.

Let's ask the user to input the city name for which he/she wishes to fetch the weather details. 

```python
city = input('input the city name')
print(city)
```

You can also hard-code the value if you will only check for yourself.

```python
city = 'bhopal'
```

Now, let's display a simple message.

```python
print('Displaying Weather report for: ' + city)

#output:
Displaying Weather report for: bhopal
```

Let's define the URL, We will make use of `format` to pass city as a parameter here.

```python
url = 'https://wttr.in/{}'.format(city)
```

It's time to make use of the `requests` module.

```python
res = requests.get(url)
```

Our resultant data is stored in `res`. We will make use of the `text` method to extract our desired weather details and let's display the result.

```python
print(res.text)
```

This is how the Weather Forecast will look like:
