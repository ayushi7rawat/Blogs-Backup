## Why Build an Effective Developer Portfolio

Hello there, I am attending a [Technical Writing Bootcamp](https://hashnode.com/bootcamp/batch-3) at [@hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@hashnode). **Hashnode Bootcamp III** is a free virtual Bootcamp to help beginner technical writers to improve their writing skill. This article is inspired by the latest session by **Annie**, @anniebombanie 

*Let's get started.*

### **A First Impression Says Everything**

**First impressions** play a vital role in building positive momentum. As J. K. Rowling very wisely said, 

> A good first impression can work wonders.

What can be a better way to achieve this than building a portfolio.

### - Online Presence

Your portfolio can reach where you cannot says a lot about its importance! It will boost your online presence. 

### - Get Hired!

A developer portfolio is a great way to demonstrate your competencies. You can customize it to showcase your interests, work, achievements and many more stuff. It reflects your real performance in domains.

### Few Tips:

- Make the best use of the About section. It is a very important section & make sure to include non-tech stuff like what do you do when not coding? 

- Highlight your top three projects briefly. Drop the links to showcase the live demonstration.

  *Tip: Revisit and update your old projects* 

- Add TESTIMONIALS! Yes, they matter! It's the best way to prove your credibility by showing that real people have had a positive experience with your products or service.

- Add a contact section. The easier for a user to contact you. higher the probability of them actually getting in touch with you.

- Do you Blog? Add it too. Yes, it counts.

- Be open to feedback, negative feedback will help you improve and get better.
